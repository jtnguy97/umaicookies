The lactation cookies are TT Cookies™ to make it easier to refer to and were named after her name and well... breasts. Our aim is to provide products that are just good: focusing on high quality ingredients and playful flavor profiles.</h5>

                <h6 class = "font_bold">All cookies use a base recipe that contains flour, sugar, dark brown sugar, kosher salt, baking powder, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. Additional ingredients are added depending on the flavor variations.</h6>

                <br>

                <h6 class = "font_bold">All cookie orders are baked fresh the morning of your scheduled pickup day. Cookies typically stay fresh and chewy for 7 days with proper storage.</h6>

                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">What are lactation cookies?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Lactation cookies, also known as breastfeeding cookies, are nutrient-dense cookies made specifically for women that produce breastmilk.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">Is there breastmilk in these lactation cookies?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">No. None of our cookies contain breastmilk as an ingredient.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">What makes lactation cookies different from regular cookies?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Our lactation cookies are made of our base recipe (see above) and include lactogenic (milk-producing) ingredients. The lactogenic ingredients we use are rolled oats, ground flaxseed meal, and brewer's yeast. We ensure all of these ingredients are verified non-GMO for your and your baby's health. Visit our Instagram page for upcoming information on specific ingredients!</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">Can men eat lactation cookies? Will they lactate?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Yes, men can eat lactation cookies! No worries, they will not produce milk if they accidentally eat these cookies :) it would just be a nutrient-dense treat packed with fiber and carbohydrates for energy.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">If I'm not nursing, will my breasts get bigger if I eat them?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Unfortunately, your breasts will not get bigger if you eat these cookies and aren't breast feeding :( it would just be another healthy alternative to a sweet treat!</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">How soon will I see an increase in breastmilk supply?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">It depends on the individual, but mothers typically see an increase in supply 1-2 days after supplementing with brewer's yeast. The results will vary from mother to mother, but they usually see an increase in supply by about 2-4 ounces each pump. Supply is also dependent on other factors such as stress, water intake, and proper nutrition. Please conduct your own research on other ways to increase milk supply.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">How many cookies should I eat?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">We recommend eating 1-3 cookies daily. Eating more than 3 cookies a day could lead to increased visits to the bathroom due to their high amounts of fiber.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">What is the difference between frozen and baked cookies?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Frozen cookies are for mothers who don't want to feel rushed to eat a whole supply of lactation cookies. They can bake them as needed and enjoy fresh, warm cookies. Baked cookies are for those who don't have time to bake or don't trust their baking skills. Baked cookies can also be stored in the freezer in an airtight container and warmed up as needed.</h6>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class = "font_heavy_howto">Will anything be included with my frozen cookie order?</h5>
                    <h6 class = "font_bold">Each frozen cookie dough order will come with one sheet of parchment paper per dozen ordered and a sachet of flaky sea salt for finishing before baking.</h6>                    
                    <br>
